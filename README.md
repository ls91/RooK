RooK
====

RooK is a project management technique that scales for individual to large scale projects. It allows projects to be respresented as "boards" which in turn illustrate the flow individual tasks within that project will take. Tasks within a project can be broken down into sub-tasks, assigned to a person and tracked against deadlines within this single solution.
